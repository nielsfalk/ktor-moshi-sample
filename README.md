# ktor moshi sample

I played around with ktor and I thought, why not use an other Json-Serializer.

This project is mainly a copy of [ktor-samples-json](https://github.com/Kotlin/ktor/tree/master/ktor-samples/ktor-samples-json) but with a sample implementation for [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi)Support
